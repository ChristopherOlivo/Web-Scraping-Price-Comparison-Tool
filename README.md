# Web-Scraping-Price-Comparison-Tool
This Python project is a simple web scraping tool that allows users to compare prices of a given product from eBay, Amazon, and Best Buy. The tool gathers product listings and prices from these e-commerce platforms, compares them, and provides a link to the site with the lowest price.
